            <li><strong>EJS:</strong> Serving as the templating engine for dynamic HTML.</li>

        <h2>Project Features</h2>
        <p>
            This application allows for full <strong>CRUD</strong> functionality (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) 
            of blog posts. Note that as this version does not use a database, posts persist 
            only for the duration of the server session.
